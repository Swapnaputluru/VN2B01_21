Loops:
-----
Loops are important in Python or in any other programming language as they help you to execute a block of code repeatedly. 
You will often come face to face with situations where you would need to use a piece of code over and over 
but you don't want to write the same line of code multiple times.

Type of loops:
-------------
1.For loop
2.While loop
3.Do-while loop

For loop:
--------
*A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
*A for loop in Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied. 
*Such a type of statement is also known as an iterative statement. Therefore, a for loop is an iterative statement.

Ex:
 x = "Welcome"
 For i in x:
     print(i)

here x = variable
     i = duplicate variable
     for is the keyword of for loop.
output is showing below:
W
e
l
c
o
m
e

Control statements in loops:
----------------------------
Control statements in python are used to control the order of execution of the program based on the values and logic.
1.Break
2.Continue
3.Pass

1.Break:
-------
The break statement is used to terminate the loop containing it, the control of the program will come out of that loop.
Use "break" keyword to break the loop.

2.Continue:
----------
When the program encounters a continue statement, it will skip the statements which are present after the continue statement inside the loop and 
proceed with the next iterations.
Use "continue" keyword to skip the next iteration.

3.Pass:
------
Pass statement is python is a null operation, which is used when the statement is required syntactically.
Use "Pass" keyword to pass statement.
