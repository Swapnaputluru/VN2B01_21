 Token:
	A token is the smallest individual unit in a python program. 
All statements and instructions in a program are built with tokens. 
The various tokens in python are :
1.Keywords
2.Identifirers
3.Literals
4.Operators
5.Constants

1.Keywords:
	Keywords are words that have some special meaning or significance in a programming language. 
They can’t be used as variable names, function names, or any other random purpose. They are used for their special features. 
In Python we have 33 keywords some of them are: try, False, True, class, break, continue, and, as, 
assert, while, for, in, raise, except, or, not, if, elif, print, import, etc

2.Identifirers:
	 Identifiers are the names given to any variable, function, class, list, methods, etc. for their identification. 
Python is a case-sensitive language and it has some rules and regulations to name an identifier.

3.Literals:
Python supports different types of literals such as Integer,float,bollean,String.

4. Operators: 
	These are the tokens responsible to perform an operation in an expression. 
The variables on which operation is applied are called operands. Operators can be unary or binary. 
Unary operators are the ones acting on a single operand like complement operator, etc. 
While binary operators need two operands to operate.

5.Constants:
	constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed.
Ex:Weeks and months and gravity and pi value ie.22/7 etc
