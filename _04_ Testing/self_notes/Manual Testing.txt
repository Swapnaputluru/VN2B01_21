Manual Testing
	Manual testing is a software testing process in which test cases are executed manually without using any automated tool. 
All test cases executed by the tester manually according to the end user's perspective. It ensures whether the application is working, 
as mentioned in the requirement document or not. Test cases are planned and implemented to complete almost 100 percent of the software application. 
Test case reports are also generated manually.
Manual Testing is one of the most fundamental testing processes as it can find both visible and hidden defects of the software. 
The difference between expected output and output, given by the software, is defined as a defect. The developer fixed the defects and 
handed it to the tester for retesting.
Manual testing is mandatory for every newly developed software before automated testing. This testing requires great efforts and time, 
but it gives the surety of bug-free software. Manual Testing requires knowledge of manual testing techniques but not of any automated testing tool.

Manual testing is essential because one of the software testing fundamentals is "100% automation is not possible."

Advantages of Manual Testing:
1.It does not require programming knowledge while using the Black box method.
2.It is used to test dynamically changing GUI designs.
3.Tester interacts with software as a real user so that they are able to discover usability and user interface issues.
4.It ensures that the software is a hundred percent bug-free.
5.It is cost-effective.
6.Easy to learn for new testers.

Disadvantages of Manual Testing:
1.It requires a large number of human resources.
2.It is very time-consuming.
3.Tester develops test cases based on their skills and experience. There is no evidence that they have covered all functions or not.
4.Test cases cannot be used again. Need to develop separate test cases for each new software.
5.It does not provide testing on all aspects of testing.
6.Since two teams work together, sometimes it is difficult to understand each other's motives, it can mislead the process
