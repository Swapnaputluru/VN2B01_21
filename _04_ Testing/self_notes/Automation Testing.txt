Automation Testing:
	Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing software tools to execute a test case suite. 
On the contrary, Manual Testing is performed by a human sitting in front of a computer carefully executing the test steps.
The automation testing software can also enter test data into the System Under Test, compare expected and actual results and generate detailed test reports. 
Software Test Automation demands considerable investments of money and resources.
Successive development cycles will require execution of same test suite repeatedly. Using a test automation tool, itâ€™s possible to record this test 
suite and re-play it as required. Once the test suite is automated, no human intervention is required. This improved ROI of Test Automation. 
The goal of Automation is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually and not to eliminate Manual Testing altogether.

Test Automation benefits:
1.70% faster than the manual testing
2.Wider test coverage of application features
3.Reliable in results
4.Ensure Consistency
5.Saves Time and Cost
6.Improves accuracy
7.Human Intervention is not required while execution
8.Increases Efficiency
9.Better speed in executing tests
10.Re-usable test scripts
11.Test Frequently and thoroughly
12.More cycle of execution can be achieved through automation
13.Early time to market
